## Loan Request Client

First component in Loan Broker is the Loan Request Client.

Loan Request Client is responsible for making first request in the Loan Broker Component. This is where a user enters information prior to the loan.

After processing the data, we package the information into a message, a data record that the messaging system can transmit through a message channel.

We recieve the data in the next component: **Get Credit Score**
